Entry 1 - Design Freeze & Planning

Today I nailed down the overall design for Lumina-FHD and put in place the key architectural decisions I'd been mulling over. I'm going with the dual-Fresnel transmissive LCD system and am treating thermal management as a big deal right now, not something to get around later on. 

I decided to start out with a bare-bones test rig to see how airflow and temperature affect the LED and LCD before even thinking about building an enclosure for the thing. I need to know how it's going to behave before I can design a case that'll keep it from overheating. Power-wise, we're going with a single 12V supply that's backed up by separate boost and buck stages for the LED and logic side of things. 

At this point, the project is pretty much design-complete and ready to move on to physical prototyping once we get the green light - and some funding, of course. Next up will be ordering the optics and setting up the optical bench to do some initial alignment and uniformity testing.
